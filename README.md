3. Mount this folder on a linux machine through smb (I use Nautilus)\
Go to `Other Locations` -> `Connect to Server` and type in `smb://windows_computer_name/shared_folder_name/` -> click `Connect`
4. Right click on empty space in opened folder and click `Open in Terminal`
5. Type `pwd` and copy its output (It will be the same every time you mount this folder, so you have to do it just once)
6. Open rup.py with the text editor
7. Paste what you've copied in step 5 after `remote_path` between two `'` symbols
8. Type the name of your project after `project_name` between two `'` symbols
9. Type the full path to directory where you want the local copy of you project to live after `local_path` between two `'` symbols
10. Place any launch parameters for your game after the `launch_paramters` in between `[` and `]` symbols. Place each parameter it it's own pair of `'` symbols. Seperate the, using commas.

Correctly configred file looks something like this:
